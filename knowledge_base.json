ProAgent: Proactivity & Feedback-Driven Adaptation\n- Feasibility: Proactive agent behaviors and feedback loops are feasible; requires careful feedback design.\n- Files: orchestrator/main.py (proactive task assignment), small_model_agent/main.py (feedback integration), scoring_agent/main.py (feedback generation)\n- Action: Implement feedback/adaptation loops; add logic for agents to initiate actions or request clarification.\n\n## 3. ReAct: Reasoning-Action Loops\n- Feasibility: Structured reasoning/action cycles can be added to agent workflows.\n- Files: small_model_agent/main.py (reasoning-action alternation), orchestrator/main.py (logging, workflow control)\n- Action: Update agent logic to alternate between reasoning and acting; enhance logging for each step.\n\n## 4. Reflexion: Natural Language Feedback & Self-Reflection\n- Feasibility: Natural language feedback and self-reflection are feasible but computationally intensive.\n- Files: scoring_agent/main.py (generate natural language feedback), small_model_agent/main.py (reflection module), knowledge_base.json (log feedback/reflection)\n- Action: Extend reward messages to include natural language feedback; implement a reflection module/class in the small model agent.\n\n## 5. STARLING: Self-Supervised RL & Hybrid Training\n- Feasibility: Self-supervised pretraining and hybrid training are feasible but require significant compute.\n- Files: small_model_agent/main.py (self-supervised objectives), orchestrator/main.py (training phase management), knowledge_base.json (training logs)\n- Action: Add support for self-supervised objectives and hybrid training phases; log phase transitions and training metadata.\n\n## 6. Evaluation Benchmarks & Logging\n- Feasibility: Highly feasible; aligns with current architecture.\n- Files: orchestrator/main.py (benchmark management), logs/agent_interactions.jsonl (logging), knowledge_base.json (benchmark results)\n- Action: Design and implement evaluation benchmarks for coordination, proactivity, and learning efficiency.\n\n## Summary\nAll major ideas from the literature review are feasible to incorporate, though some (like natural language feedback and self-supervised RL) may require more resources. The main files to update are the agent and orchestrator main.py files, knowledge_base.json for structured logging, and logs/agent_interactions.jsonl for data collection. Evaluation and logging enhancements are straightforward and recommended.\n\nReferences: litrature_review.md, knowledge_base.json, orchestrator/main.py, small_model_agent/main.py, scoring_agent/main.py, logs/agent_interactions.jsonl"
