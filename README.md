# Agent GRPO Training Project

This project implements an agentic workflow with GRPO (Generalized Reinforce Policy Optimization) training, using a microservices architecture with RabbitMQ for communication.

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- UV (for fast package installation)
- Docker and docker-compose (for running services)

### Setup Instructions

1. Install Poetry:
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install UV:
```bash
pip install uv
```

3. Configure Poetry to use UV as the installer:
```bash
poetry config installer.modern-installation true
poetry config installer.parallel true
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

5. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

6. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Project Structure
- `orchestrator/`: The main orchestration service
- `small_model_agent/`: The learning agent using GRPO
- `scoring_agent/`: The evaluation/reward agent
- `rabbitmq/`: RabbitMQ message broker configuration
- `adapters/`: Model adapter storage and registry
- `logs/`: Persistent logging directory

### Running Tests

**Important:** To ensure that orchestrator logs are written correctly and test results are not affected by the persistent orchestrator, always run tests using the provided isolation script. This will:
- Stop the persistent orchestrator service
- Clear RabbitMQ queues
- Run the test script (which will log events to logs/agent_interactions.jsonl)
- Restart the orchestrator after the test

To run an isolated end-to-end test:
```bash
python isolated_rabbitmq_test.py
```

This ensures that the orchestrator in test mode can process its own messages and log all events without interference.

## Code Style and Best Practices
- Type hints and docstrings required for all functions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Message schema validation
